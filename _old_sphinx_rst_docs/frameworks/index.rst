        :link: torch/index
        :link-type: doc
        :class-header: sd-bg-primary sd-text-white

        Complete PyTorch integration for both inference and training on all Neuron hardware.

        * **TorchNeuron Native** - Native PyTorch backend with eager execution and ``torch.compile``
        * **PyTorch NeuronX (torch-neuronx)** - ``Inf2``, ``Trn1``, ``Trn2`` (inference & training)
        * See: :doc:`/frameworks/torch/pytorch-native-overview`

    .. grid-item-card:: JAX on AWS Neuron

        :class-header: sd-bg-primary sd-text-white

        **Beta release**

        Experimental JAX support with Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI) integration.

        * **JAX NeuronX** - Neuron hardware support
        * Research and development focus
        * **Status**: Beta - active
