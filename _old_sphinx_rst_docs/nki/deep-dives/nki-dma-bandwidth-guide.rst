Guideline to Avoid Under-Utilizing DMA Bandwidth
=====================================================

A common misconception is that the hardware's internal memory interleaving
removes the need for large contiguous DMA payloads. In practice, small
fragmented transfers underperform badly regardless of how the hardware
distributes traffic across memory channels. This document clarifies why large
payloads (≥4 KiB) are required to saturate HBM bandwidth.

How HBM Channel Interleaving Works
-------------------------------------

HBM is organized into multiple independent channels and banks. The hardware
uses address interleaving to spread DMA traffic across all available channels,
avoiding hot-spots where one channel becomes a bottleneck while others sit
idle. This achieves higher effective channel utilization and more consistent
bandwidth across diverse access patterns.

However, channel interleaving only solves the *channel utilization* problem.
It has no effect on the per-transfer payload size seen by the DMA engines.


Why Large Contiguous DMA Payloads Are Required
------------------------------------------------

The fundamental problem is per-packet overhead. Each NeuronCore has 16 DMA
engines, and every DMA transfer incurs descriptor setup, synchronization, and
semaphore-to-start latency (~1300 ns cross-engine). When payloads are small,
the engines spend more time on overhead than on data movement, and the DMA
packet rate---not HBM bandwidth---becomes the limiting factor.

Channel interleaving does **not**:

- Reduce the number of DMA packets required for a given transfer.
- Remove the need for large contiguous payloads per DMA operation.
- Eliminate DMA packets-per-second (PPS) bottlenecks caused by small
  transfers.

Channel utilization and per-engine throughput are independent concerns.
Interleaving addresses the first; payload size addresses the second.

Large contiguous payloads (≥4 KiB per partition) amortize this fixed overhead
and allow each engine to sustain its peak throughput:

=====  ==============  ==============  ==============
 Gen   BW / Engine     Engines / NC    Aggregate BW
=====  ==============  ==============  ==============
TRN1   17 B/ns         16              272 GB/s
TRN2   23 B/ns         16              368 GB/s
TRN3   33 B/ns         16              528 GB/s
=====  ==============  ==============  ==============

With small payloads the engines cannot fill their pipelines, and achieved
bandwidth drops well below these peaks regardless of how well the hardware
distributes traffic across channels.


Bandwidth vs. Payload Size
----------------------------

The relationship between DMA payload size and achieved bandwidth follows a
saturation curve:

- **< 256 B per partition:** Severely overhead-bound. Achieved bandwidth is a
  small fraction of peak.
- **256 B -- 2 KiB per partition:** Improving but still below peak. Per-packet
  overhead is a significant fraction of transfer time.
- **≥ 2 KiB per partition (minimum recommended):** Approaches peak bandwidth.
  The kernel efficiency guide recommends at least 2 KiB of contiguous data per
  partition for all data types.
- **≥ 4 KiB per partition (target for full saturation):** Fully amortizes
  per-packet overhead and saturates the DMA engines.

Practical Guidance
--------------------

- **Maximize the free dimension** of every DMA tile. Target ≥4 KiB per
  partition for peak throughput.
- **Coalesce transfers.** One large DMA covering multiple logical sub-tiles
  is faster than many small DMAs to adjacent addresses.
- **Do not rely on hardware channel interleaving alone** to solve bandwidth
  problems caused by small or fragmented transfers. Channel utilization and
  per-engine throughput are independent concerns.
- **Use full partitions (P=128).** Fewer partitions means fewer engines
  utilized, compounding the effect of small payloads.
