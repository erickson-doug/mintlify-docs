NKI Deep Dives
==============

This section provides in-depth technical documentation and guides for advanced users of the Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI). These deep dives offer detailed explanations of NKI concepts, programming patterns, and best practices to help you maximize the performance and capabilities of your NKI code on AWS Neuron devices.

      :link: dge-documentation
      :link-type: ref
      :class-body: sphinx-design-class-title-small

      Control how DMA descriptors are generated: pre-computed, software (GpSimd), or hardware DGE.

   .. grid-item-card:: DMA Bandwidth Guide
      :link: nki-dma-bandwidth-guide
      :link-type: ref
      :class-body: sphinx-design-class-title-small

      Guidelines for maximizing DMA bandwidth with large contiguous payloads.

   .. grid-item-card:: NKI Access Patterns
      :link: nki-aps
      :link-type: ref
      :class-body: sphinx-design-class-title-small

      Learn about Access Patterns (AP) to directly specify how the Trainium hardware accesses tensors.
